### Hi there 👋

I've started coding two years ago 🐣
I used shell, c, python, go, solidity, html, css, javascript, react, redux, vue, nuxt, node, sql 

I'm super curious, I think I'm addicted to the web 🦄
I spend most of my time learning stuff there (youtube, cryptotwitter, reddit, newsletter, blogs, wiki, google etc ...)
My principal expertizes are in blockchain, computer science, economics and science
I've got a real passion for blockchain that started in 2012 and only got worse year after year 🥵
